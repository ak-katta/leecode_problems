Problem Name: Types of Triangle
Difficulty:- Easy
Problem Link:-   https://leetcode.com/problems/type-of-triangle/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-20
Approach:- Brute Force
Time Complexity:- O(1) : as we are checking three conditions at once so time complexity is 1
Space Complexity:- O(1) 
Explanation:-
  It just follows a simple approach of comparing the sides. If all sides are equal , it is equilateral. If any two sides are equal and follows triangle validation equation a+b>c, it is isosceles triangle.
  If none of the sides are equal, we just need to verify triangle validation equation. If none of the above conditions satisfies, then it is not a triangle.
