Problem Link:-   https://leetcode.com/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-16
Approach:-
Time Complexity:- O(n)
Space Complexity:- O(n)
Explanation:-
    iterate through the original array
    if next element is smaller than the current element , we subtract that smaller element and we have to pay that amount
    if next element is equal to current element , we pass that case
    if next element is not smaller than current, we search through out the array for next smaller integer
    if no smaller element found , we just give no discount
    save the outputs to another array and return result
