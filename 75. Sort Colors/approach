Problem Name: (75) Sort Colors
Difficulty:- Medium
Problem Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-17
Approach:- Two Pointer
Time Complexity:- O(n)
Space Complexity:- O(1)
Explanation:-
   zero_pos and two_pos are pointers which stores the index of the position where '0' and '2' will be stored
   now loop iterate through the array and place '0' and '2' corresponding to zero_pos and two_pos values
   here we only apply increment operator when either num[i] is '0' and '1' but not when num[i] is '2' because after swapping , the element that comes in that position is not tested either it is 0,1 or 2
