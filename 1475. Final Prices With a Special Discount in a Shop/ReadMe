Problem Link:-   https://leetcode.com/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-16
Approach:- Brute Force
Time Complexity:- O(n*n)
Space Complexity:- O(n)
Explanation:-
    iterate through the original array
    if next element is smaller than or equal to the current element , we subtract that smaller element and we have to pay that amount
    if next element is not smaller than current, we search through out the array for next smaller integer
    if no smaller element found , we just give no discount
    save the outputs to another array and return result
